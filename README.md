First repository
My name is Andy. I'm 30 years old and now starting to learn programming. 
I've worked at UPS for 10 years and looking to branch out.
I have some limited college experience (about an AAS worth and then some), hoping to become a coder and get into cryptography (Pen tester)
I like puzzle games.
